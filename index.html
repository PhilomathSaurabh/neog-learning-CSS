  <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
  <div>CSS is more verbose than HTML</div>
  <ol>
    <li>Keep on searchign the keywords </li>
    <li>Use google to learn more of CSS</li>
    <li>2 ways to use CSS in a website</li>
    <li>stlye-tag - use it directly in the body. </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Using Style tag for CSS</h3>
  <!-- <style>
    body{
      color:red;
    }
  </style> -->
  <div>
    <p>just by adding color to the style tag - the whole of website font color changed to red!!!</p>
  </div>

  <h3>2nd way of CSS</h3>
  <div><p style="color:red">use style attribute</p></div>

  <div>you can see that the above text changed to red because red style is given to the para type.</div>

  <h3>3rd Way of using CSS</h3>
  <p>having a seperate stylesheet and importing that in the html file</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Now link the css into html</li>
    <li>link using the a tag and it will apply css.</li>
    <li>Import the css into the head of our blog</li>
  </ol>  


  <p>I am creating this blog to showcase what all I have created in these days of web development</p>

<div>Here is my list 
  <div>1. Item 1</div>
  <div>2. Item 2</div>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<div>When you have to practice CSS, Break the website in multiple peices, create multiple batches and practice yourself. 
<h3>Some of the imp tips Sir gave during the lecture</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create compoennt library for twitter</li>
  <li>Start using states in different website</li>
  <li>Take any website and make a component library in that</li>
  <li>Practice more and more</li>
  <li>THe best is when you go to website which no one knows, make component library for that</li> 
  <li>When you visit different sites you will see the same component getting repeated again and again. They make component libarry</li>
  <li>You also have to replicate the same. </li>
<li>Learn to follow the symmetry in desing. Don't go haywire in creating multiple types of buttons.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Learning Nav Elemets</h3>
<ol>How to create a Nav? 
  <li>Create a Div</li>
  <li>Now you have to create a list beacuse a Nav bar contains multiple items.</li>
  <li>You will need an <a> tag because you will be clikcing on the multiple Nav items.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h4>Nav applied</h4>
<nav>
  <div>Polymath Saurabh</div>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>

<h3>@header</h3>
<div>You have a header tag which can directly be used.
  This is also called as symantec component. 
</div> 



<div>You can choose a theme color for the website.</div>

<li>Go to tailwind, choose color and paste it in undraw, you will get awesome images</li>
<li>How to download? </li>
<li>For websites and blogs - SVG is good because on zoom the image will not get pixalated.</li>
<li>Download the file and create a folder "Images" add the file here.</li>
<li>Rename the file according to the relevance</li>
</ol>

<header>
  <img src="images/saurabh_coding.svg" alt="">
  <h1>Playing with the website all the time :)</h1> 
</header>

  <li>get the link to that image.</li>
  <li>copy the source and paste it into the code.</li>
  <li>Get the image on the internet from websites</li>
  <li>If you are not able to do what is being taught, you can always go to codepen and code snippets there</li>
  <li>learn using img tag in the code pen website</li>
  <li>dont use public images of differnet person even if its public :P Use coredraw website!! All images are free.</li>
  <li>Another Source of images - UnSpash </li>

</ul>

<h3>Sections?</h3>
<div>Sections are also tag. It shows that your page has diff things.</div>
<ol>
  <li>Section will clearly divide the page into multiple parts.</li>
  <li>Best thing is that html and CSS is completely open and you can directly copy paste from any website and you can know how to create that!!!! AMAZING AND AWESOME!!!!</li>
  <li>You can understand the formatting of page, eg wikipedia page on India</li>
  <li>You can understand any source code, look into wikepeida, microsoft, they have used the symantec tags perfectly and you will be able to learn a lot from these. </li>
  <li>Lets start using section.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>@Section</h3>
<div>the most amazing thing about section is that it will expand to the entire page, end to end.</div>
<div>Section cna have headings, paragraphs etc anything.</div>
<div>Below you will see examples of sections</div>

</section>

<hr>

<h4>learn more</h4>
<ol><li>
  Anything that is there in head is not visible.
</li>
<li>read more about the meta tags.</li>
<li>If you are not able to absorb then no problem but go ahead.</li>
<li>Starters code for 10 - 12 hours per day to learn more of coding.</li>
<li>INline vs Block</li>
<li>See headings - it is taking entire row. This is block element</li>
<li>Go to the secondsary links - this will take just text image shape. This will not take whole space. So this is taking space of its own, so this is inline elelemt.</li>
<li>Footer and Section</li>
<li>If you have peices of elements which are of same theme but disjointed little bit, then you can use sections to make it more understandable.</li>
<li>eg WWII</li>
<li>You will have to udnerstand multiple things - background, during the war, post war treateis, present situation - all of these can be multiple sections</li>
<li>look for asise in html</li>
<li>you dont need to use javascript to have a working website!! Dont just go after what market says!</li>
<li>If still you are not able to understand inline and block elements - go to mdn wesite and read and learn from there</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why did I started writing all the notes on the website only?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>It would be online all the time!</li>
  <li>easy to recall while reading the notes and looking at the components</li>
  <li>better recall value</li>
  <li>easy for others to understand too, but I am really doubtful someone would want to read html written by noob :P :D</li>
  <li>I can rearrange the whole stuff and it would be fun when I learn more of web development to re-align the code</li>

</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Using Footer</h3>
<div>We have footer tag to be directly used in html</div>

<footer>
  <div>Finally we are at the page end!!</div>
  <ul>
    <li>social</li>
    <li>link 2</li>
    <li>link 3</li>
