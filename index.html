  <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
  <div>CSS is more verbose than HTML</div>
  <ol>

    <li>Use google to learn more of CSS</li>
    <li>2 ways to use CSS in a website</li>
    <li>stlye-tag - use it directly in the body. </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Using Style tag for CSS</h3>
  <!-- <style>
    body{
      color:red;
    }
  </style> -->
  <div>
    <p>just by adding color to the style tag - the whole of website font color changed to red!!!</p>
  </div>

  <h3>2nd way of CSS</h3>
  <div>
    <p style="color:red">use style attribute</p>
  </div>

  <div>you can see that the above text changed to red because red style is given to the para type.</div>

  <h3>3rd Way of using CSS</h3>
  <p>having a seperate stylesheet and importing that in the html file</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Now link the css into html</li>
    <li>link using the a tag and it will apply css.</li>
    <li>Import the css into the head of our blog</li>
  </ol>

  <p>point would be in ordered and numbered</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to google fonts to get good fonts for stylesheet</li>
    <li>fonts are very heavy - 4 - 5 chapers can be on this.</li>
    <li>copy the fonts syle from google fonts into our own file.</li>
    <li>what is Sans font and what is not? Homework</li>
    <li>Start using class selector in CSS</li>
    <li>we will start with class - container</li>
    <li>Add class container in some of the divs and check whether its working or not?</li>
    <li class="imp">Align the text right</li>
    <li>use csstricks website - amazing place to learn lot about css!!</li>
    <li>using span class and adding style to the span. This will help to add extra colors</li>
    <li>read about the properties and diff things, initially it will go over head, note all of it and it will get
      repeated again and again</li>
    <li>span is inline element, if you want to use something in the same line then span can be used.</li>
    <li>strong is used to bold and highlight something.</li>

  </ol>
  <hr>

  <h2>links in CSS</h2>
  <p>We have to define the color as a variable and use it throughout the app</p>
  <ol>
    <li>use root element for styling the entire website</li>
    <li>--primarycolor: red this will be used throughout app.</li>
    <li>what is the difference bw the link tag and a tag?</li>
    <li>
      <link /> is an empty element, i.e. it can not have anything inside of it. All it does is specify a relationship
      with another document. Additionally, the
      <link> tag is only used in the

      <head> section.

        <a></a> on the other hand, is not an empty element and specifies an object to be created on the page - like a
        clickable link or image - which takes the user to some other location. This tag is only used in the

      <body> section.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Content -- Padding -- Border -- Margin</li>
      <li>This is asked a lot in the interviews.</li>
      <li>CSS Units</li>
      <li>read about these units - rem, px, em, </li>
      <li>we use rem so that when we increase or decrease the font size, the fonts, spaces everything increases.</li>
      <li>Look into the BEM naming convention for CSS</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

        component libarry</li>
      <li>You also have to replicate the same. </li>

      <li>Was not able to align right the navigation bar because I was adding align right to the list class, what was
        needed was adding text align in the .navigation .link class</li>
